# Trippy-with-Ananya

I've been thinking of writing a letter for you forever now. Ever since you gave me mine, I could not stop thinking about how special it made me feel and I wanted you to feel the same special joy I feel when I read it every single time, but I did NOT want to spoil that with my handwriting and oh god the typos and the scribbles and the crossed up lines 🤡, I just couldnt Im sorry LMAO. I could not do that to you. You prolly wouldnt even be able read it. So I did what I think I do best lol deploy it on github lmfaoo, but seriously girl youre so fucking special to me I just want you to be happy all the time and I wanna do everything I can to see you smile. I suck at writing and putting my feelings out and I already know its gonna be no where like your letter but here goes nothing ❤️

My turn to say it this time 😌
'First things first'

HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY BABE!!!!🥳🥳🥳

Turning 21 like in your words is a big fucking deal and you finally made it, jeez you young bruh are we even born in the same year 🚼 lol, no one stopping you from getting into clubs anymore so lets fucking gooo lmao. but fr have the best day ever. And an even better year. Let yourself live free amidst this world of chaos and enjoy every second of it (me rn: 😎)
I know you're really trying super hard with your placements and it's prolly a lot more stressful than the smile you put on your face tells me but you got this (fax). I just know it. And obviously I'm never wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️ am I? (its a rhetorical question. You better not answer that) So have hella fun and keep having fun. Don't let anything get in the way of your happiness. (Now that I think about it I feel like youre gonna point at me while you read this 🤡)

Anyways while its still your birthday, I got a story to tell you (are you confusment rn?🤨)
Long long ago on this very day (which was also auspicious btw, I just didnt know if saying 'auspicious very day' made sense, GRE tomper fr 🤡) a young child was born by the name of Ananya (oooohh didnt see that coming did ya)
Ananya had a wonderful dad by the name of Rohit who lived in the same country as the multiple Ananyas born that day (oooohh didnt see that coming either did ya), and of the other Ananyas born, there was one Ananya born that was born in the same hospital as Ananya Raj 🥰 ... and this cute little meatball of cuteness (The me falling for you photo still makes me blush lmao CUTEST FUCKING THING IN THE WORLD) 🥰🥰🥰 who has grown up to be the sexiest, prettiest, smartest, kindest (surprisingly also hates on random people but I will learn da waes), the most organized-est (GRE tomper 🤡), the most dressed-up(lol, harish mess would agree), still obv the most cutest woman ever and has changed my life forever.

Okay now to the recap goodies 🎁 and since you already covered most of it in your letter I would like to take the oppurtunity to respond to some of the *bold* statements made in it.

March 6th 2022 was the first time I had seen you. I'm ngl this girl started having a thing for me already wtf? Thank fucking god I was wearing the turtle neck lmao. Thank fucking god my dad got me that basket ball and Thank fucking god I faked my accent 🤡🤡🤡. But most of all thank fucking god Utkarsh (we dont wanna get into later details of his life. start was p good tho lol) was friends with Riddhi coz of online classes coz of Covid coz of China eating bats 🏏 and Riddhi became your roomie and you being you gave your power bank to Riddhi's friend and me being me walking Utkarsh to return the power bank. Like Ive always said: the butterfly effect is insane on that one 🦋. Lemme just say it again.... Thank fucking god 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 (This ones for mummyji: Sai Ram). March 8th 2022 was when we first talked and holy fuck the sexual tension was crazy in Darling Cafe. Guess they got their name right coz that where I met my darling 😏. We were on our A games at least I was, it was prolly just a casual tuesday for this hottie. I still remember you actually liking my songs and oof Hands on Youuuuuuu 🔥🔥🔥 Thank fucking god to that as well. (This might just end up being a letter full of me thanking god for you). Also can we just forget the fact that I got absolutely destroyed in basketball that day lol. Like that never happened what are you talking about.

You did take my hoodie super quick. You did take some steaming hot photos in em that I let myself take screenshots of super quick (I still look at em all the time 😏😏). You did talk to your friends about me super quick. You did come running to hang out w me super quick. and you ask me who's the real winner. IT'S MEEEE!! I still remember blushing so hard talking to you late at night (I wish we could do that more often but my sleep fucks with everything smh). talking to you while walking around VIT. talking to you on zoom (AISEC pro zoom subcription 😎) with out a care of what my roommates thought coz I didnt fucking care I just wanted to be w this girl all the fucking time. You forgot to mention one more thing that you took super quick. Its me lol and Im definitely winner here.

You had me addicted to them strawberry skies lips (PS pls kiss me more 😗 drooling rn) 💘

Aight now coming to the trips. Oh the trips. Dude, I'm not gonna lie if it wasn't for you I prolly wouldve just spent everysingle day on campus. Never once thinking my parents would ever let me go out on trip, being the most normal dude ever. Thank fucking god lol.
Best decision I've ever made while being slightly tipsy (I was not drunk lmao). I remember waiting for an hour on the streets just talking to you on call, coz I just couldnt wait to be with you again. And once I did I spoke what both my heart and my mind wanted to say. Thank fucking god she said yes to a dude who prolly smelled like cheap alcohol. And the rest is history. Bangalore, Chennai, Bangalore pt 2, Chennai pt 2... took a break from travelling ... Singapore wtf lmaooo no fucking way. I still dont believe we pulled that off (girly said she wanted a trip in the letter, I didn't think international lmao). We travelled so much together. Explored so much together. Didnt care if things didnt go exactly how we planned it. Didnt care if we were in a shitty hotel (We'd just turn the lights off and forget what time it was 🥵🥵). DIDNT CARE WE MISSED AN EXAM LMFAOO. We'd just be happy we were together. and I fucking loved every second we spent together. From the beaches and malls, to the fancy restaurants, and to dancing in the rain, dancing on the streets, dancing clubs and to fast food restaurants, and fucking our brains out, till cuddling afterwards and laughing together about random reels and incidents or just about how stupid we are. Oh lets not forget your period scaring the shit out of us coz the condom broke first time at the worst possible time ever lol 🤡. I was living the dream and I loved every second of it. I'm so grateful for you and I wish I showed appreciation for you more often (I found out a lil later that you got the shittier end of the stick and I'm sorry for that. Uh apology paragraphs later lol its not ending in this much)

Bruhh I never thought I could ever type so much lmao especially about how I feel about someone. You'll prolly read this in like 2 mins lol. My overachieving girlie 🥰. You said you couldnt believe being w me for 11 months. guess what? its been 18 months. And it puts a smile on my face whenever I think of my girlie becoming a little version of me and me becoming a little version of you. All those McCheeses, Fries, Deserts, cant forget about the MacnCheeses lol, the pizzas, mountain dews (had an anti climatic ending ngl) 🤡, burgers, tacos, the ice creams, the cold coffees, ohhh my personal fav the lime soda lmao 🤡🤡 we eat a lot lol, and today isnt gonna be an exception. All those late night study sessions, you reminding me to get my assignments in order lol (I'm such a fucking mess with out you I dont think I wouldve passed lmao - Thank fucking god), doing project docs together, making projects together. I dont know about you but I love doing shit together with you. Even if its something as boring as studying. More commonly, all the pointless walking around, and sending a shit tonne of reels to eachother whenever we get time coz thats the only way healthy couples communicate with eachother 😌 (you fr *giggles). I don't know why it makes me so happy to annoy you all the time lol. Maybe, you being annoyed just shows me I still have all your attention lol. Its fucking stupid coz I get so incredibly unconfortable and I just wanna fix it asap when you get mad at me and I manage to piss you off all the time lmao (Im a fucking idiot 🤡). Pls forgive. Oh arguing with you about randomest pointless things also makes me weirdly happy for some reason idk I got issue babes 🤌🏻(I'm bringing it back. prolly didnt use it right tho lol). 

18 months is a lot of times to have ups and downs in a relations. and boy did we have our ups and downs. We had the mother of all ups and downs. I have disappointed you for god knows how many times and you continue to be with me. I'm so grateful for you to choose to be with me and I'm so sorry for everything I've done over the entire time we've known eachother and I'll continue to keep trying to be better for you even if its very small steps. I know you hear this a lot but I genuinely really mean it every time I say it. You're always on my mind and all I ever want for you is you to be happy always even in times of struggle (and for you to eat food mf you better eat 3 meals a day 🔫). You have no idea how important you are to me and I absolutely tresure you. I know I don't show it often but its true 🤷🏻‍♂️. And lately we've been hella busy with our own things but its all for the light at the end of the tunnel. The horrors persist (me and VIT) but so did you and I'm proud of you and I'm so fucking grateful for you. Obviously I couldn't fit in all of our 18 months of being together into this "letter". but I tried to talk about whatever I could pull of the rush of happy emotions I felt as I thought about us. I really just had the biggest smile while writing this. and I hope you like it too lol. I kinda tried my best to put myself out there lmao. 
One last time lol... Thank fucking god she wanted to be w a loser like me but not coz she saw me as a loser but she saw past that (an annoying idiot) and still chose to be with me. Thank you god. more importantly Thank you babe. for always being with me. for always taking care of me. You deserve so much more and you'll get there one day. I just know it. And obviously I'm never wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️ am I? (its a rhetorical question). You got this 😌. 

I hope you enjoy your birthday and Ill say it again like a broken record lol I really hope youre always happy no matter what. You dont know how much of a blessing you are to my life. and Imma try to do a lot better to at least try to be fraction of what you are to my life. I'll always be your biggest supporter. and obviously...

I really truly love you so so much ❤️❤️ (I should really say it more often)
